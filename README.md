# Amplicon (Marker Gene) analyses!

This is a repository in progress!

These are scripts I use to analyze **amplicon sequences**. These scripts can be adapted for metagenomes, single end reads, etc.

Currently I am using a high performance computing cluster that uses a Slurm manager.

These are scripts I use to analyze **shotgun metagenomes**. These scripts can be adapted for amplicon reads, single end reads, etc.

Currently I am using a high performance computing cluster that uses a Slurm manager.
